## Reducing Anxiety, Unlocking Creativity

I believe creativity and anxiety exist on the same spectrum—when we reduce one, we amplify the other. My approach to tech and design intentionally:

- **Eliminates ambiguity** - Clear communication about what happens at every step
- **Provides consistent structure** - Predictable layouts and interactions that feel familiar
- **Removes distractions** - Clean designs without overwhelming pop-ups or auto-play features
- **Offers responsive feedback** - You'll always know where you stand in the process
- **Gives you control** - No rushed decisions or arbitrary time limits

## For Neurodivergent Minds (And Those Who Appreciate Direct Communication)

As someone with ADHD and autism, I understand the need for clear, direct communication without the social fluff. My services are designed with neurodivergent thinking patterns in mind:

- **Explicit expectations** - I'll tell you exactly what to expect at each stage
- **Structured processes** - Clear beginning, middle, and end to every project
- **Direct communication** - No reading between the lines or decoding required
- **Sensory-considerate design** - Websites and materials that don't overwhelm the senses
- **Flexible collaboration methods** - Working together in ways that suit your processing style

Some call this approach "psychic"—I call it respecting how different brains work. If you appreciate straightforward communication and thoughtful processes, we'll work well together.

## Why Work With Me

My journey through marketing, management, and software engineering gives me a perspective that goes beyond code. I understand the human side of technology—how it feels when systems don't work, when websites don't convert, and when digital tools create more stress than solutions.

**My Approach:**
- **Sustainable Solutions** - I build systems that won't burn you out
- **Inclusive Design** - Accessibility isn't an afterthought, it's fundamental
- **Trauma-Informed Support** - Technical guidance that respects your pace and process
- **Creative Problem-Solving** - Finding the sweet spot between technical excellence and practical implementation

## Let's Create Together

Whether you need a robust web application, guidance through your tech challenges, or custom craft creations for your business, I'm here to help you bring your vision to life—without the tech anxiety.
