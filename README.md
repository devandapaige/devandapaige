## Where I want to see myself in ten years:
I got into the tech industry as a significant pivot to my life, and I have loved this journey and want it to continue. I hope to get a certification in Project Management and see myself in a supervisory position down the road helping new juniors getting their footing, explaining tech in an accessible way to clients, and creating projects that make me proud. I want to have a flexible schedule with a remote-heavy employer, which will allow me to work on my Tree Farm in Pennsylvania in the Fall, and stay home with my needy cats during the rest of the year. I hope to have a position that allows me to continue my life without impacting my health, relationships, and lifestyle; if anything, things should be even more routine and even better. [🔮 I see a beautiful deck in my future where I can read my morning emails with a cup of coffee]
