## What Sets Me Apart

As a neurodivergent engineer, I offer:

### 🧩 Pattern Recognition
I quickly identify system inefficiencies and optimization opportunities that others might miss, leading to more elegant solutions.

### 🔍 Attention to Detail
My natural tendency to notice small details means fewer bugs, more comprehensive test coverage, and higher quality code.

### 🌐 Systems Thinking
I excel at understanding how components interconnect, making me particularly effective at architecture design and debugging complex systems.

### 🚀 Hyperfocus
When engaged with challenging problems, I can maintain intense concentration until reaching optimal solutions.

### 🎨 Creative Problem-Solving
I approach technical challenges from unexpected angles, often finding innovative solutions that conventional thinking might overlook.

## My Collaboration Style

I believe creativity and anxiety exist on the same spectrum—when we reduce one, we amplify the other. I thrive in environments that offer:

- **Clear documentation** and well-defined requirements
- **Structured communication** with regular check-ins
- **Asynchronous options** for deep thinking and processing
- **Quiet focus time** for deep work and problem-solving
- **Direct feedback** delivered with clarity and kindness

## Let's Create Something Amazing

I believe the best work comes from clear communication and mutual respect. I'm currently dedicating my energy to my primary projects but am always interested in hearing from fellow builders and potential partners who share a similar ethos.

If you have a project that aligns with my work in automation, accessibility, or creative tooling, please reach out via email. A brief, thoughtful introduction is the best way to start a conversation.
