### 🌐 Systems Thinking
I excel at understanding how components interconnect, making me particularly effective at architecture design and debugging complex systems.

### 🚀 Hyperfocus
When engaged with challenging problems, I can maintain intense concentration until reaching optimal solutions.

### 🎨 Creative Problem-Solving
I approach technical challenges from unexpected angles, often finding innovative solutions that conventional thinking might overlook.

## My Collaboration Style

I believe creativity and anxiety exist on the same spectrum—when we reduce one, we amplify the other. I thrive in environments that offer:

- **Clear documentation** and well-defined requirements
- **Structured communication** with regular check-ins
- **Asynchronous options** for deep thinking and processing
- **Quiet focus time** for deep work and problem-solving
- **Direct feedback** delivered with clarity and kindness
