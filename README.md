## How did I get into tech?
* I come from the time of custom MySpace themes and Neopets sites that taught me to get creative with how I use the computer and browsers. I've always had a fascination for website developement, but never really knew where to go with my passion.
* In 2016, I got a chance to celebrate a game launch with Respawn and starting looking into different roles that I could start seeing myself in where I could be creative. This was while I was working a dream place at a law firm in customer coordination, and was not seriously considering a career pivot.
* In an effort to find more of a balance in my personal life, I quit the corporate world, and focused my energy on odd jobs, digital art, and I started looking into ways I could further help small businesses in my area. where I learned some basic CSS to edit websites.
* While the world was locked down in 2020, I was talking courses in HTML/CSS and JavaScript and realized how much I was enjoying it. I signed up for a part-time boot camp with Lambda School in the Fall of 2020, and I haven't looked back. Now I can make and create more than I ever thought was possible, and I cannot wait to see what comes next.
